# Mia was the eighth most popular girl's name in 2022. My little sister was named after Mia Hamm, and I suspect she's not alone. I suspect that there are plenty of people out there named after the women's soccer legend. Let's check out the popularity of the name Mia over time.

nationaldf %>%
  filter(name=="Mia", sex=="F")

# Wow! I see stable numbers through the 1980s and early 90s, then big spikes in 1997 and 2005. I would think that those jumps are connected to the 1996 and 2004 Olympics at which Hamm and the USWNT won gold.

# Okay, one more time. This time let's try Kylian, for futbol superstar Kylian Mbappé.

# Okay, that was cool but now I want to track changes in popularity on a larger scale. I'm going to make a data frame that takes each name in the data set and tells me its percent change over one year, five years, and ten years.

# I found that the one_year_growth variable doesn't tell me a whole lot. I think the sample size is too small and therefore the names can seem a bit random. But the five_year_growth and ten_year_growth variable give us some valuable insights

# Just as WSJ said, Dutton and Kayce can be linked back to the show Yellowstone. But other names also give us an insight into what's relevant in our culture right now. Amiri, a quickly growing unisex name, is probably connected to ascendant fashion designer Mike Amiri. Ermias, the fourth-fastest growing boys name, is the real name of rapper Nipsey Hussle, who was murdered in 2019.

# Not sure what's up with Jase, but it's no surprise to see Alexa and its similar-sounding counterparts up here. I'm almost certain that has to do with Amazon's Alexa voice control. The name Isis also decreased by 77.6 percent over the last decade -- woof.

# Research tells me that the name first spiked in popularity in the 1980s after celebrity couple Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley named their daughter Alexa. The name nearly peaked in popularity in 2015, which is weird because Amazon launched its Alexa the year before. But it's all downhill after that.

# Alexa was the 39th most popular girls name at its peak in 2006
```
